8/30/16 Tues.Today is my first day in robotics class and I am very excited about this course. Before taking this course, I already have some kinds of programming and building robotic's technic and knowledge. I would like to take this course because it can provide me more deep about robotics and I can also have one year of computer credit, which I think taking this course can help me a lot throughout the year and also in my college years. Throughout the day, I think I learn lots of information about robotics, which I think it is the basic thing to start learn about robotics and it is the easiest way to learn about how robotics work and process.
